1,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 14, 2021",Fun Game would like to know how the CPU is decided on the dice roll but overall a fun game to play brings back good memories when playing this as a kid.Update from 4 stars to 1 . I had to this game is more more based on luck then skill I wouldn't recommend spending money on this game.
2,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","The bots are at an unfair advantage! The game is very well made but, it's so unfair even on easy! Shouldn't have to struggle that hard when playing on easy! Bots and dice rolls are total garbage! Change the bot settings or I want my money back!!!"
3,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 12, 2021","Absolutely LOVE this game, but it has not been working for the past couple weeks. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times with no change. Keeps crashing on startup."
4,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 16, 2021",I've been unable to even get into the game for 3 weeks now. I've sent reports but have heard nothing and the game still crashes before I'm even in. Horrible game. I want my refund!
5,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 20, 2021","It's a good game but doesn't have the live video like the advertising says. Live video should be for all players at all times to make it more fun. So, this is just another regular Monopoly game."
6,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 13, 2021",Crashing constantly. Every time I put houses on my property the game freezes and I can't end my turn. We have to start a new game just for it to happen again. It's aggravating
7,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 24, 2021","Awesome, great boards to play with and pieces. Monopoly game has improved greatly since the last time I played. Great job on this app will always okay this for while to come."
8,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 15, 2021",It was working fine but stopped after the last update. Paid for the Winter Package too. It's been a few days and still no access. I want a refund if I can't open the app?!
9,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"July 27, 2020",The online part of the game is perfect. But playing singleplayer everything is rigged and there is no difference between the hard and easy difficulty bots. Stop lying to us atleast.
10,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 19, 2021","Ive had this game and played it on this phone before. But everytime i try to load it, it stops on the monopoly screen and freezes. Ive uninstalled twice cleared cache and date twice and it still will not load."
11,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 8, 2021",I've had this game for a year or 2 and had it rated 5 stars but all of a sudden the game won't open I click the icon and it'll go black and then back to my home screen. It's a shame I really liked this game.
12,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","Good when you can play. Ran in to a user ""Whatever"" who stalls the game if he doesn't get the trade he wants, maybe a child. No way to report the user or communicate what so ever. Would love vote to kick, report and avoid options for players like this."
13,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 9, 2021",I would of gave this five but it crashes in the middle of games with no reasoning at all makes me not want to play because you can be in the middle of a great game and boom just freezes and stops working
14,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 16, 2021","I can't believe how much this game crashes. I have been able to play 1 game, that's it. Now I can't even get back into the game...absolute waste. But, it was fun while I got to play! 🙄"
15,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 20, 2021","Some players lollygag and have multiple accounts. This causes the game to be frustrating rather than fun. Sad part is, there's no way to report the behavior. Fix it & I'll adjust my rating."
16,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 18, 2021",App stops working soon as I open it. Have a feeling it has to do with the recent Android update. Edit: Game developer blames it on Android 12 and the S21. Maybe you just need to update your app?
17,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 16, 2021",I would have put a 5 stars but going to jail 4 times in a row is statistically impossible. Not sure what kind of algorithm is used but it is bad.
18,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 18, 2021",Game keeps crashing. I only got to play it once and after I got done and got back on it keeps crashing. Please fix your game.
19,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 9, 2021","Love all the options, the different maps, and the ability to play either by yourself or with other people. Totally worth the money!"
20,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 20, 2021","Was good until I went to open the game & it crashes. Eveytime since I ca t open the game at all & I've tried deleting & reinstalling the game, multiple times which didn't work."
21,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 15, 2021","Very charming little game. Lots of theme purchase options, but I'm enjoying just the classic look. 3D city is fun."
22,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 10, 2021","I wouldn't play this if it were free, too late now. Microtransactions for EVERYTHING and there's nothing random about the dice roll. 5mil you made off garbage.🤮"
23,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 22, 2021",Worst game ever it lags pauses in the middle of the game it takes it so long for people to go the game was just stop I'm telling you I want my money back I need a refund I only played this game one time since I downloaded it I need help on how to get a refund from Google Play
24,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 13, 2021","I got the game and haven't been able to play a single game on it. EVERY SINGLE TIME I click start game, it crashes instantly."
25,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 9, 2021","Finally got to play after a week of the app continuous crashing, and it was worth the wait. Lots of fun and at a quick pace."
26,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 23, 2021",Love this game! I only wish there was some sort of reward system. Like ranks and how many wins and losses. Other than that I'm obsessed!
27,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 8, 2021",Bought it and for a week straight it has never worked. Turns on shows hasbro then turns off. Never had a chance to even play it. S21 Ultra
28,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 11, 2019",Great way to play! I always loved monopoly and now its great to play anytime I want. It is a very fun game!

31,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","If you think its bad, YOUR WRONG because there is so much you can do, the community is so kind and nice, the levels are so fun and im happy this game is out. Thank you robtop and the whole game is so good, the build mode... makes the game have people. Everyone can wait until 2.2. We can do this."
32,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","This game is so unique! I LOVE IT! The rip-offs of this really suck, so this is the best one of those jumping-cube games, plus, if you don't wanna play the 21 main levels, play the endless online levels! And you can make your own levels using the level editor! Robtop, PLEASE MAKE 3.0!!!!!!"
33,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 8, 2021","Obviously one of the best games of our generation. With neverending fun, great music, and incredible surprises, Geometry Dash supplies you all of those elements. This is one of those games that actually requires skill and builds skill as you progess. Love it!"
34,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 21, 2021","Short little thing about this game, it's awesome, hard but fun, basically this game has everything you could ever want, except for one little problem, one day, when I went to play this game, all of my progress was gone! 5 stars --> 1 star | I am never playing this game again!"
35,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 12, 2021","This game is one of the best I have ever played. Great music, great levels.

After all, it is the biggest update we had since 2.0! Even though I know about 2.0, I have been playing since only June 7, 2017. Hope you like this review, and stay motivated!"
38,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 19, 2021","Love the songs, and game. The official levels are fun, and it's more fun to play other people's levels you may rage every now and then though. When you buy the game you have the entire game. It's not pay to win it takes skill and dedication (2.2 when)"
39,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 15, 2021","This game is very good, it is a great time killer. And ot is fun. You can customize your icon many ways and you have to do some work to do it. Once you finish a level you feel good that that level is good. 10/10 great game."
40,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 21, 2021","One of the best games i have ever played! Plus, it has absolutely no ads at all! The only problem is the time it takes to update. Sure, big updates are nice, but it would be better if you did a lot of small updates, that would be just as good!"
41,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 21, 2021","This is so fun! The levels may be hard, but their goals to work on! AND you can make your very own levels in this one! (This one is the full version). This is the best game ever! And RubRub, i'm very excited for 2.2! Keep up the great work! And where is my chicken?"
42,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 13, 2021",This game has been my favorite over the past years of playing.. this is definately worth the money. You can make your own levels an play your friend's levels. It is truly an awesome game to play.
43,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 20, 2021",Cars wont connect or show up or supertrucks all worked fine a long time ago on old dead app but now wont connect using same phone as then
44,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 28, 2021",Not happy with this app. Asks for acess to media and if you decline the app doesn't work. Awesome. Thank you for just taking my $3 and giving nothing for it.
45,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 3, 2021",Just spent $3 for a game that does not work. App will now connect with the 4 cars that I have sitting on the track. WASTE OF MONEY!!
46,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 30, 2021","I can't even play the game. $3 for a game that says choose you car,but the cars I have don't appear. They don't connect at all."
47,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 10, 2021",It doesn't let you pick your cars sometimes and they also made it cost 3$which you have to get if you want to play the game.
48,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 13, 2021",Keeps telling me my battery is low after charging them for a long time and then disconnecting
49,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 7, 2021",I would love to know why and how 2 cars that have been charging for 48hrs be dead? Having the same problem as Zayne Deadpool
50,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 20, 2021",I can't use it on my tablet that is why i gave it 1 star but my other divices 5 stars much better then the free one PS thanks DDL PPS The solo tournament is not working every time I back out after word I get sent all the way back to crashbot please fix even with a new account I cannot get to work
51,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 12, 2021","I think it's Okay... A Played It And It Was Pretty Fun But Then It Started Crashing When I Started To Scan, And i couldn't Refund, Therefore its probably just DDL's (Digital Dream Labs) Way Of Gettig An Easy 3 Bucks Of The Play Store."
52,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 7, 2021","Needs more content. Once tournament is completed, there is nothing to do. Also it glitches constantly and plus DDL does not care enough to add content to Overdrive in general."
53,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 12, 2021","Big fan of the relaunch. I'd never played the 2.6 version before and was skeptical of the decision to put resources into launching the old version. This is a much cleaner game. Works well on multiple Android devices. There is a bug trying to play without doing the training first, but otherwise 👍"
54,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 27, 2021",Tournament mode has never worked. Cars fail to stay connected. Ordered tires from DLL. NO RESPONSE. Basically I have yet to have a positive experience or reassurance that the app or any other issues will ever be addressed in a professional manner.
55,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 5, 2021","I missed this version of overdrive, but why I had to pay for this made no sense to me, but I did it nonetheless. Edit- So the story has a progression bug, if you head to the home page none of your progress will save and you'll need to restart"
56,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 3, 2021",Sad to say it did not work on my OnePlus. The app is no longer playable on IOS. I've supported both platforms and my user experience is not good. The app continually crashes when I attempt to start a race. I had to use the old anki version for it to work.
57,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 11, 2021",I have used this on several devices incuding fire tablets. And LG k92 5G with not much issues. Sometimes it fails to initiate track scan. I do love the throttle contoll in this vs the Fast and Furious App. But i want the 2.6..... To support MXT and Ice Charger.
58,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 1, 2021",Please stop complaining about the cost of this game. The $3 for this game is a small price to pay to have a new company take over the reigns from Anki and continue to support this great game. I'm looking forward to future builds with expanded futures. Thanks Digital Dream Labs.
59,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 29, 2021",Big thanks for reviving the platform. Works well for an initial release and the gameplay is much better than the Anki 3.4 version. Very much looking forward to future updates
60,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 24, 2021",Great start but there are some issues which they pledge to fix. Thanks for keeping Overdrive alive!
61,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 15, 2021","Super cool , better than the old app but the garage is super glitchy.also can you add a button to reset the shop?"
62,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"September 29, 2021","Theres are lots of glitches and the memory for the tournament isn't saving, but very cool 😎"
63,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 13, 2021",i was excited for this but theres alot of problems in the app. 1st whenever you scan the app closes 2nd i lose most of my weapons i thought it was gonna be great but it sucks.
64,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 16, 2021","Much better than the App made by Anki. I'm really enjoying playing again, I am not receiving my medals though which is a bit annoying. Maybe have a look devs? Other than that really really happy with the app so far!"
65,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 22, 2021","Updated Oct 2, 2021 Works great. Thanks for the updated! ...waiting for app to work properly.. update Sept 2020 app works better.. can't save progress.."
66,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 5, 2021","this game one of the hidden gems within mobile game history. great graphics, wonderful chalenging levels, and like the best soundtrack ever. the illousions in this game are so interesting. i broke my brothers brain with them! great game, would play again."
67,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 26, 2021",This game is the BEST! I have been searching for a simple game that challenges my brain for logic. MC Escher has always been my favorite artist. What a special surprise to finally find the perfect game!
68,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 4, 2021","Wonderful game, definitely worth the small price. This game is great for on the go puzzles and car trips. Challenging, but not extremely hard, a comfortable difficulty."
69,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 3, 2021",This game is AMAZING! The puzzles are fascinating with higher dimensional structure. Really well done. Soothing and interactively musical. 10/5 stars honestly. 🔥
70,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 13, 2021",Well worth the purchase. This game is beautiful and engaging. It's not too easy but not too challenging and I can't stress enough how beautiful and enjoyable it is to experience this story unfold
71,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 22, 2021",Really fun... but it lasts like 2 hours max. I thought I'd get a lot more levels for a game I was paying for.
72,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 18, 2021","Everything about it is easy as pie, but the only thing that I had trouble with was the puzzle after seeing the millions of caskets in that tomb."
73,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 7, 2021","Hands down one of my favorite games in the app store. I seldom replay games but this is one I will pick up again. The music is lovely, I absolutely adore the art. It's a really laid back and relaxing puzzle game. I just really love each level."
74,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"September 30, 2021","Fun game! While the visuals and gameplay are amazing, I do wish the puzzles provided more of a challenge."
75,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 19, 2021","Beautiful, peaceful game with some very nice storytelling. I agree with some reviews that it's not very difficult, but I don't think that's a bad thing, it's sort of a meditative experience."
76,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 16, 2021","I completed both versions of this game in less than two days. It is joyfully confusing, and so incredibly fun. Huge props to the developers for designing such a clean and crisp game, and for coming up with amazing levels that are all so entertaining."
77,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 23, 2021","Such a cool idea but now that it has been imitated to death it's interesting to go back to the original and see how it holds up. Answer: not so well. There's hardly a game here, it's all super linear with the next step being obvious 80% of the time."
78,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 22, 2021",Wonderful but short. Well worth a few bucks. The puzzles weren't chellenging but the craftsmanship was superb.
79,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 14, 2021",Not worth the money. It was easy. I beat it in probably 1n half hrs almost not trying. Ive spent less on games that lasted months. I want a refund.
80,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 24, 2021",I can't even describe my love for this beautifully designed and executed experience of a game. Love it so much I'm going to buy merchandise!
81,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"September 18, 2021",Tranquil and challenging This is a relaxing yet slightly challenging game. Best played with headphones. It's a few hours of fun. Fun to go back and play again after a few months.
82,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 15, 2021",You'll spend more time watching graphics than solving puzzles. The puzzles are extremely easy.
83,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 6, 2021",Best Its cheaper than infinite flight. Its lack the amount of plane Infinite has but still good. I love they keep adding new planes. Please add an antonov. If you want to fly from Europe to America expect OVER 4HRS of flight time just like real life. I really love it
84,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 5, 2021",The best airplane game no joke it's a real simulator and you can use it offline but with limited features but even limited it's great and when I say sim I mean sim real flight hours and a GLOBAL MAP! expect to put in some serious hours with this game! If you like airplanes this is the game for you!
85,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 2, 2021","This is the best airplane game I have ever played. The graphics are very high quality on the airplanes, you can even make your own emergency. All in all this is a great game for retired or new or future pilots."
86,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 7, 2021","One of the best mobile flight simulators in my experience. Although you only get 3 planes to start with, it's still a good game. I definitely recommend this game."
87,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 25, 2021","This is a game i love to be honest but, the app needs a lot more work. I feel like I'm wasting my money. When i flight certain airlines it keeps stalling. I have to see better improvement before i upgrade."
88,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 23, 2021",This is by far the best and most realistic game that I've played. Not to mention the customer service is exceptional! Worthy of all five stars!
89,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 15, 2021",After recent update all the lights dis-align needs to fix right away otherwise is lousy Why this apps Flight Simulator infiltrate by abnormal people? Or I should say toddler.
90,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 18, 2021",Good game I wish it had more realistic engine sounds and They added the Global 7500. But Overall good.
91,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 5, 2021","This is so fun, the plane models are a little weird so I'm wondering if there'll be an update reworking all the plane models from 2019."
92,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"November 30, 2021",Very great gameplay. Really would like to see some new planes in the game. The one that I would like to see is the Antonov 125
93,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 12, 2021",Very positive game and very fun and auto polit I great for when you take off when your playing while your parents are driving autopilot helps
94,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 14, 2021","Great game, not a bad price either, when on guard warning is issued could there be emergency response planes, plus it takes to long to get to expert, also when will there be more military c130 c17 or a c5 even jets? And how about military bases or carriers for jets?"
95,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 4, 2021","If you want thee ultimate REAL life like flying experience then this is the game you will want to download. Also I must add.... Spend the 4.99$ and get the PRO version it's totally worth it, think. About it. Non PRO=3planes v.s. PRO=30+planes..... it makes ALL the difference."
96,Monument Valley,4.8,$3.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"October 23, 2021","I love the FS!! I have a request. When you are on approach and you see the airport code box.

The background scrambles, the control format actually had a guys face in place of the control analog. I'm playing it on a tab, so is that the issue or what."

It crashes everytime while trying to do the draft drills. I have filed reports before but never has it been fixed. Wasted my money.
383,Kingdom Rush Frontiers TD,4.7,$1.99 $0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"September 8, 2021",Awesome game but can you maybe update it once in awhile I feel I wasted 7$ on a game that's only been update so many times. Also can you add a few new accessories maybe something more realistic ?

393,Kingdom Rush Frontiers TD,4.7,$1.99 $0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"November 13, 2020","I Love the great graphics and difficult gameplay. The only thing I think is wrong is every time I get over 10 points, and get the ball I get double or triple teamed which takes away some of the fun of ISO, but overall a very good game."

402,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 25, 2021",Perfect early Christmas present. I found holden here's to hoping some mission has him in it. Also was wondering if you could reduce damage to fleet ships from ion storm really nukes my fleet any time I have to go through one.
403,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"December 8, 2021","A great game, I personally recommend this for people who enjoys mainly about the wonders of space travel, trading, ship battles, and faction conflicts. It's like starsector but lite version. The rpg series never failed to make me bored."
404,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"October 29, 2021",Very happy glad to see this game came out. As someone said. As close to starsector as you can get on the phone

408,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 3, 2021",Excellent adaptation of the board game & play is comparable to the Steam version (so far single player only). Only gripe is that the graphics get mighty tiny on my phone (Pixel 5) -- a workaround for this would be nice. Worth the $!
409,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"September 29, 2021","When it works it's great. Unfortunately its buggy. Sometimes it will not allow me to change to a different action, sometimes it will not allow me to move forward at all. These issues tend to resolve if I exit the game and go back into it, but it is very frustrating."
410,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"September 30, 2021",Beautiful and fun game! I am so happy it finally came out for mobile! This is possibly my favorite board game port. The gameplay is smooth. I did not run across any glitches or any other negative issues. I definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves board/strategy games.
411,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"October 10, 2021","Excellent digital version of an awesome game. The tutorial is good for beginners. You can play Wingspan anywhere anytime on the train, on a lunch walk, or in bed!"
412,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"October 20, 2021",Very well done....a bit fiddly at first but I got the hang of it without the tutorial (have played board game) within a handful of plays...
413,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"September 30, 2021",AI could be a touch better and it would be nice if a seasonal background was always available but otherwise one of the best digital applications of a board game I have seen. The extra animations and customizations really make this pop.
414,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"July 20, 2021","One of my favorite board games is in my pocket now? Amazing. Lovely digital rendition of Wingspan. If you like birds, or board games, or both, you'll love this. Very relaxing way to unwind."

422,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 20, 2020","Great quality but buggy on pixel 3, in multiple games had no way to proceed on decision, the icon to continue disappeared and made the game unplayable, refund requested"
423,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"January 24, 2021",Fun. Needs the expansions though for its full potential. Edit: Notifications are broken. Will update my review when fixed.
424,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 23, 2020","Despite the fact the game and interface is ok, the online playing is very buggy. I got disconnected many times, even though for me it was like the other players are pending their turns. And ofc, i lost a lot of Karma points for that...its a pity, the game is worth it though"
425,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 5, 2020",EDIT: update has fixed the bug. Works well and plays beautifully now. Would like to see a tutorial on the automa though. Stuck at tutorial because the screen doesnt show the green arrow to confirm my actions. Refunded because I cant play it :(
426,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 26, 2020","Love the game, but the online battle was a disgrace. the connection doesnt good enough for 5 mins plays. And i lose so many Karma (battle poins) because of the trash connection. pls fix it devs."
427,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"April 5, 2021",Really solid adaptation. Great animatios and music add to the atmosphere. A few little crashes but expected for the initial launch. Can't wait for the expansions to be added
428,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"January 1, 2021","Whatever problems earlier reviewers had, I haven't encountered. A friend's list would be very helpful. Can't wait for the Expansions!"

430,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"December 16, 2020",One of my favorite board games comes to the Google Play Store! That app is fantastic a must buy if you love board games.

434,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 25, 2020","Amazingly fun game. Unfortunately, there are lots of bugs in this version, at least for me. Most notably, buttons and controls stop working in many situations, meaning I have to restart the game. Also, small objects often are impossible to move around"
435,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 23, 2020",Great game you can make whatever you want as long as it is not copyright or inappropriate super fun game do recommend it but it is not as good as regular scribble notes
436,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 9, 2020",It's okay put a free play option to just do anything you want with other people it would be better but it's a great game would recommend it would be awesome if it was free but it's pretty cheap compared to unlimited
437,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 9, 2020",You can't move objects or if you do move them you better like that spot because it's not going anywhere. And you type out an object it's hard put it where you want to go in the first place.
438,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"December 17, 2020",I couldn't even complete the tutorial because you cant move objects. If I could I would get a refund because this is a terrible game.
439,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"December 18, 2020",Fun but I rated it 4 stars because soon you run out of stuff to create but very good idea to make a remix.
440,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"May 8, 2021","Please get rid of the limit of the things that you can put in your place *EDIT* goodness... I was so dumb, I didn't realize the point of scribblenauts unlimited at the time."
441,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"February 1, 2021","It's ok, just kind of feels like a budget scribblenauts game. The creation options are limited, there's no adjective editing, it just feels lacking in every way"
442,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"April 17, 2021","This is a very solid and original game, nice graphics, good controls, and the game is extremely good at making you think outside the box. The only problem with me is the fact that everything doesn't come together when bought, but a solid game altogether."
443,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"February 4, 2021","Great game, but it's a little glitchy. Every time I open it, after about ten or twenty minutes of playing the screen starts flashing and I have to close it and reopen it. Really sucks when you're almost finished with a level and have to redo it."
444,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"February 22, 2021","The puzzles can get a bit repetitive, there also way too easy at times. The game could definitely use a little work in the animation department but other than that its a great game. The reply value is almost limitless."
445,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 24, 2021",Good Game
446,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 8, 2021","Good. A bit laggy at times. Overall decent. Not the best to start on though. I would suggest console or PC first. Drains battery fast, and also takes a large amount of data if you play for a while. So I would definitely buy it if you want to, but don't start your minecraft career with it."
447,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 21, 2021","As minecraft grows older the memories I associate it with slowly fade out of relevancy. Although they will still hold a place in my heart, for being one of my first gaming experiences, for being the place I found my first friends, and for staying true to its original purpose. Fun."
448,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 19, 2021","I've always wanted to play minecraft, but all I had was an Xbox 360, and some probably know how old that minecraft version is. NO cats, horses, or multicolor beds! For the long run, I got the whole minecraft experience, I do despise the once in a while shake of the camera when I move it though."
449,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 8, 2021","I have been playing for almost 9.5 years, I love the game, but it took 10 years apparently to patch a bug. You used to be able to not get hit through blocks, now you can! If you do not put full walls and there is a 1 pixel gap in the opposite corner you will in fact get hit and possibly die."
450,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 5, 2021",This is so cool and the graphics (for being cubes)are great. And there is plenty of lore like herobrine. But I wish you could see old versions on the app itself. It takes some money but it's worth it.
451,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 22, 2021","I love this game. The possibilities are endless! You can build whatever you set your mind too. This blocky world is awesome!

452,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 14, 2021",I love the game. Ive had it for a few years now but idk why now but a day ago my co tries for moving and jumping have disappeared of the screen and its annoying.

453,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 4, 2021",I love Minecraft and play it often! The only issue I have is sometimes when I hit the jump button it doesn't work but that's really my only issue Otherwise I've had no issues and I love the new update! I definitely suggest minecraft to anyone who finds themselves bored often.
454,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 2, 2021",The best online and offline game on the planet + they are constantly adding really great updates so you can have a better experience in the game. From new blocks to new mobs it is the best game in the universe. I really recommend it for people that want to have new experiences.
455,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 23, 2021","I love this game, I always have. However the new caves and cliffs update has deleted all the mods I paid for. Along with my worlds.

456,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 23, 2021","I love building on this game and exploring and finding new things that I haven't seen yet (Don't play very much).

457,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 7, 2021","Version 1.17 was amazing,But, I am making YouTube videos, And really need a camera toggle button, Please add one.

458,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 23, 2021","It's super creative, and it's fun because you can join a friend's world. But... there are a lot of things that should be added; umbrellas, hedgehogs(ofc), pink fairy armadillos, other kinds of dogs, and actual moving cars."
459,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 1, 2021",Best btd game in a while would recommend the time and money spent to get the game. But don't buy anything after the purchase of the main game. Totally fun and doesn't take long to get advanced setups and have fun with the game. You can even create your own custom maps. Again totally recommend.
460,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 8, 2021","Great game. Would definitely recommend you can always expect new content and any play style can have a fun time, people looking for a long playtime or something to just play in the background, casual or hardcore. If you're debating whether to buy the game it is completely worth it :)"
461,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 3, 2021","A lot of different things to do, upgrade, unlock and it is overall a really good game. Lot of maps and monkeys and hero's and difficulties and just you can try a different strategy every single game,also there is no ads. It is just so fun to play"
462,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 11, 2021",Been so bogged down with the pay to play and ALL THE ADS. there are very few if any ads here and while there is still an aspect of pay for more features; it seems more fair. Other games you can easily spend over 100 dollars and your STILL scrambling to get anywhere. This game is great!
463,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 21, 2021","I think it is the perfect successor to btd5 with every good quality from that game put into this one and then more, it is such a fun game and has given me hours of fun, overall, this is truly an amazing game just showing what good games can look like"
464,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 21, 2021",I love the game and all the updates but it still has some issues in the multiplayer mode. It is still glitchy and has trouble getting into the game some times. My brother and I were going to play together but he is still waiting to get in.
465,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 24, 2021","For $.99 you can get the BEST tower defense game. You'd be a fool to pass up a 99 cent game like this, totally worth. I've gotten more play from a 99 cent game, than some of the games I own on steam. You can get this on steam too, BTW but it's like $10 so nah. This one is the way."
466,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 24, 2021","I love this game, except there's a problem with cooperation mode, the lag, getting kicked out, but mostly getting kicked out. It's not a complaint ,but really if you were to fix it I'd be happy."
467,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 17, 2021","One star because Co-op mode is practically unplayable because of serious lag issues. Will update if my experience changes... *Update 2021* issues have been fixed, and the new content added is AWESOME. This game is top 3 one of my favorites! Well worth the $5, and sometimes it goes on sale as well ;)"
468,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 19, 2021","Love the game, but for some reason when I try to play with one of my friends it says the game versions are incompatible. Other than that the game is amazing. The bloonchipper would be a great addition to the monkey crew."
469,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 9, 2021","Great game. It would be a whole lot better if you BT6 creators could put the Bloon chipper from Bloon Tower defense 5 on this game. If anyone doesn't understand what I'm saying, play Bloon tower defense 5, and you will understand what I'm talking about."
470,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 16, 2021","it's basically your normal tower defense game, BUT! WITH MONKEYS. besides that it's a very good game with working achievements and events and also good gameplay, it also has a save file feature for entering and exiting maps, maps are well designed as well. Good for a strategy game."
471,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 15, 2021",I base all other game reviews off this game. The entertainment for the price is incredible. The more you play the more in depth you can get with strategy and they just keep giving more!

474,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 12, 2021","easy to pick up, hard to master for a small, fun little monkey game, it gets challenging but the sandbox of it makes up for some of the impossible levels and builds you can make, ive got hundreds of hours"

477,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 8, 2021",Coop is better. It looks like the person with the slowest device should be host and all others should set auto start to off. Screen record may be slowing it down. Time.Deltatime. Perform a ram test prior to match then autoswitch host

479,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 3, 2021",Love this game so much. The paragons add a fresh new play style. The only thing that I can think would make this better is secret agents from btd 5 or the bloon chipper. Can't wait for the next new boss bloon and next paragon. Also I wish the teir3 monkey bank would let you deposit money again.
480,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 21, 2021","Just purchased this game and tried to open it, instant crash. Just a black screen.

482,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 15, 2021","It was 100% worth the investment. For a free app. At $5 it's not outrageously expensive or anything, but it feels like the price point creates a ""value vs investment"" internal debate..."
483,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 17, 2021","This game is so horribly rigged when verging the AI it doesn't even try to hide it, the dice roll is not by chance at all, every single roll every single game l you land on chance or non properties while the AI get double rolls on properties everytime, at least make it not looked rigged"
484,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 19, 2021","""difficulty"" is basically just how much does the AI get given the roll it needs. DLC is insanely priced. Only buy it if you literally can play online or just do not care about a well designed game. Terrible."

487,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 24, 2021","Just really fun, super intense and very strategy heavy, you cant just throw your units all around or else you'll get your units killed real fast. its not THAT replayable but if you have spare time this game is super good or if you need to make your brain work really hard too haha."
488,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 12, 2021",I really cool defense game with different dynamics. You must learn to adapt and respond using the topography of each island. Not a pay-to-win.

497,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 8, 2021",Good game. I recommend playing if you have nothing to do. I've seen the bug reviews but I'm not seeing it. But overall I like this more than FNAF 4. In Wich I suggest you play also.
498,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 14, 2021","Wow. Definitly harder than the first game. BB is such a great twist so you can't just sit back and relax with your mask on. Puppet is great, and the minigames are cool too. Stuck on night 2 already :("
499,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 19, 2021",It is a good game. The graphics and quality are good. You just have to really focus to get through the nights.

500,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 13, 2021",FNAF2 is the best game of the series IMO. I love everything about the Android version. My ONLY complaint is that the mask button on the lower-left corner doesn't always respond when I hit it.
501,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"November 17, 2021","i love this game and it is litteraly my childhood but besides the point of that, i really like the design and setup of the game. i like all the characters and i like the fact that you can wear a mask when the animatronics come close to the office area. 10/10 thank you."
502,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 11, 2021",A great sequel or should I say prequel to the first game with a lot of new characters and mechanics and it also does a great job at expanding the lore although it can get pretty difficult at times but overall it is still a great time

505,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 16, 2021","Foxy can hide behind other animatronics, so you have to guess whether he's in the hallway. If it weren't for that or the several seconds you need to flash him, this game would be playable."
506,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 20, 2021","The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star review is because of a weird glitch on the menu screen where it won't let me click the ""Continue"" or ""New Game"" button."
507,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 8, 2021",It's so cool and scary a can't even turn on the vent light or the hallway light but the Freddy mask is here for me and foxy and the puppet the trick with the mask won't work on them they are smarter than the others
508,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"November 28, 2021","This fnaf game has more action in it and I appreciate that. And if your looking to get jumped scared, this may be the right game for you! Over all I would rate it 7/10 maybe 8.5/10 or even 9/10."

PLEASE fix this."
514,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"November 27, 2021","One of my favorites in the franchise. It's stressful, thrilling, and has great controls.

The controls on the bottom could also be more sensitive as sometimes I have to press them multiple times which can also cause me to lose."
521,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"October 18, 2021","This is the best out of all of them in my opinion, the only thing wrong is that most of the time the light doesn't work on the hall which makes it harder to get rid of Foxy. Other than that this game is wonderful!"
522,Geometry Dash,4.6,$1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Arcade,"December 19, 2021",This game is more harder than Five Nights at Freddy's 1 there is a lot of animatronic but it is fun.

525,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 20, 2021","Amazing game. Have it on pc as well. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys strategy and deckbuilding. Hidden gem. Although id love to see the devs fix a couple of the issues with playing cards after accidently touching one, but if you figure out how to get it deselect its fine."
526,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 23, 2021","This has always been one of my all time favorite games, since it's PC release. Currently on my second run to Ascension! For new players, focus on maximizing your damage for stage 1. Keep your deck lean, don't take a card after every fight"
527,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 19, 2021",I have been waiting for FOREVER for this to be on mobile! Just like the original PC version. Not 5* because the UI is a little wonky and there are some relics that aren't working correctly.
528,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 2, 2021","Awesome card game with tons of replay value! If you've been on the fence, you won't regret the purchase! It's a game you can pick up and put down easily (quick toilet sessions on work breaks ^^), but you can also spend an hour or more as well (without even noticing)."
529,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 17, 2021","Excellent game, but the android implementation is garbage. The seed system does not work (it gives the incorrect seed code to your runs), the UI is very faulty, it's a battery drainer, and it takes forever to load. The actual game is fantastic and I would recommend playing it on PC via Steam."
530,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 24, 2021",Game is amazing as it is on PC. Only reason I haven't given it a 5 star is because I've maxed out The Silent and completed/won a run and I still have 3 cards locked for her. Everywhere I've looked says it's a bug and I have had no success trying to resolve it.
531,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 5, 2021",I love the game and jumped when I saw the game I had put 100's of hours in was on my phone.

534,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"November 29, 2021","The original game is great, but this is a sloppy port. Card selection is sticky, so it's easy to select a card you didn't intend, and all the dialogs are clearly designed with a mouse in mind"
535,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"November 27, 2021","My only real grip is the controls. Having to hold down onto every single part I want to remove gets really annoying. A button to enable ""removal mode"" which just removes whatever you want in a single tap instead of a hold, which you can toggle on and off on the corner of the screen would be awesome."
536,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 7, 2021","Ive dreamed of this game for so long, and its so fantastic now thats its here! But.... It crashes so badly! If i build too fast, or get too close, build too big/complex, it all goes black. I want this to be good, but my situation is tragic."
537,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 20, 2021","The game is fantastic for what it is but is most lacking in variety. You can only put down land and different color houses. It needs things such as parks and a way to stack land, it always has to be flat. Other than that very nice and I always lose track of time playing"
538,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 24, 2021","This is a lovely little toy for building wee seaside towns, or whatever you like. It lends itself to touch very well, and it has all the same charm as the desktop version.

539,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 13, 2021","Super cool, super fun... at first. I wish there was more to do though. I would love to spend more time in this world. It would be cool to start in the mountains or other terrain instead of only in the water."
540,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"December 8, 2021",Quite relaxing! One problem: it is very annoying when you go to build something but it keeps deleting even though you're not holding your finger down. I have tried building floating areas and it keeps deleting. It's hard to get that build 'sweet spot'. It discourages my gameplay a little.
541,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Adventure,"November 2, 2021","I've had this game on PC and when I heard they were making a mobile version I was thrilled.

The difficulty is still there, although I don't feel it as sharply as I used to. All I want now is a full sequel or expansion. Maybe a level editor for PC?"
572,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"November 2, 2021",This game is fun if you are persistent can be frustrating because it requires you to scale up a mountain with just a hammer and pot. It also has poetry but it can be turn off as well as music. I like it alot so I suggest if you want a time killer and willing to spend 5$ for something fun
573,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"December 15, 2021","There isn't anything wrong with the game itself but there is no good sensitivity, if I do a circle around the guy, he tucks in the hammer and when the sensitivity is enough for him to go in a circle, its all he CAN do."

I uninstalled this app because it was asking for some sketchy permissions including making and managing calls, email access, and pretty much anything you can give permission for.

595,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"September 17, 2021",Works good but it can't play the roms from the SD card. It only let's you get them from the internal storage sadly. Unless I'm wrong about that. I not sure where they be at because when I select SD card. It just shows the files from my phone and not the SD card.

The noises are loud and the game moves in a fast pace a lot which I don't really mind but with the fast pace is the constant sound effects that add chaos and even with rules the game seems unbalanced and chaotic.

607,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Casual,"December 17, 2021",Just like the real life card game except A LOT more microtransactions. Not really play to win but there are the possibility for microtransactions on pretty much every screen.

615,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Casual,"December 15, 2021",Paying 2 bucks doesn't get you the whole game. Just one map. The controls are wack. The physics aren't realistic like they claim. Touchgrind Skate is superior. And that's surprising

625,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Casual,"December 23, 2021",The game play is fun but unlocking anything takes a ton of coins. If you want more than the first park you HAVE to pay real money. Wish I could rate higher but there's nothing keeping me playing I do a couple tricks and get bored because it feels like I'm not progressing at all.
626,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Casual,"November 3, 2021",Very fun everybody is complaining about how you have to pay for the maps but seriously the maps are very cheap once you buy some you can have a lot of fun in this game so I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a good skateboarding game for mobile devices

629,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Casual,"December 7, 2021",Good game great controls but it keeps adding coins to my inventory even though I did not buy them. I'm just worried it is charging me for coins I did not buy.

638,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Casual,"November 9, 2021",This is a great game but the reason its not a five star is because you have to pay for any new map

651,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"October 16, 2021","Fun game. Worth 3 bucks. Engaging fun and diverse. Like StarCraft. Good controls. Great mission length.

652,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Strategy,"October 7, 2021","Great game. An actual RTS for mobile! I think they did a great job keeping it simple for mobile, but keeping to the genre with research and unit production. Great job devs!"

It's great. I put 4 stars because some features are missing from pc but that's a given. Phones are more limited than pcs and consoles great fun.
1540,Hitman Sniper,4.4,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"September 28, 2021","Seeing people play this on YouTube set a very high expectation for me about this game. So walking into it I fell in love, the music was amazing, the mechanics where easy to learn. If you are stressed out just play this and you will be relaxed. All in all I give the game 5 stars."
1541,Hitman Sniper,4.4,$0.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 1, 2021",Solid game. Good balance between playability and sound physics/engineering concepts. Cool enough my 3-year-old niece will stay engaged with it and robust enough for my mid-40s old gamer brain. Chill instrumental music is a nice bonus.

1545,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"December 6, 2021","Great game, the only problem I have is that with newer phones having taller screens, it makes it very hard to actually play the game.

I have a OnePlus 7pro, maybe it's because of the curved edges, but it should be fixable."
1548,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"December 16, 2021","This is an excellent port from the PC version. It takes a little bit to get used to the controls, but they are pretty intuitive when you do. I highly recommend turning off the auto triangle function and building your own. Makes it much easier to get accurate builds that way."
1549,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"November 13, 2021","Would be fun if not for the bugs. Buttons on the top of the screen get permanently hidden when notifications come up, sound settings don't work at all, background music sometimes has an echo of itself, and several other controls have unpredictable behavior. App hasn't been updated in years."

1551,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"September 29, 2021",Game was probably good. But after every level it asked me to install an app I hate and never want to use. Google play games cloud or something stupid like that. I hate it and never want to see it again.

1553,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"October 20, 2021","the game is really fun, it is challenging at some parts and a little frustrating! I love the music in this game.

1554,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"September 29, 2021",It was a really great game I can't stop playing its also available on pc for 10$ but its still really fun on mobile. there is a bit of problems I had with the game like the tutorial doesn't teach you everything so I kinda had to experiment and look at videos on YouTube.
1555,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"September 27, 2021",Its a fun game. Very challenging. But the controls seem a little unintuitive. I wish it snapped to a graph a little more instead of being so free hand when you draw. Makes it seemingly impossible to make things even and nice looking without putting in a ton of work.

Feedback would be appreciated."

You can legitimately get further by random swiping than you can trying to evaluate your choices. Bunch of random deaths that are not foreseeable or preventable. The combat is random and awful.

But in other words, great game and game franchise."
1969,Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy,3.9,$4.99 $1.49 Buy,Top Paid,Simulation,"August 8, 2021",Paid apps should not have high cost pay-to-win in-app purchases. Heroes that used to be unlockable through gameplay are now pay-to-unlock only. Very disappointing.

1976,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"December 22, 2021",Edit: The 1 ⭐ review is a result of making a bad game. The pay to play mechanic is just the cherry on the top of the whole experience. The worse game of the series. I hate all the changes that were made and now they sell you towers and heros. Shame on the developer for leaching off their fans.

Loved all the previous games but this one gets ridiculous even on casual. Obvious money grab forcing you to buy more or grind for gems (which I would expect on a higher difficulty).

1991,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"September 13, 2021",Fun bridge building game pretty much the best out there. Other bridge builders are slow or have very limited designs. Polybridge is a breath of fresh air with its cartoony yet realistic physics. 2$ is a steal.

1998,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"August 9, 2021","Good game, although they never finished the mobile version. Shows which material is selected but not which tool, which gets in the way all the time. Also a bummer you don't get any of the leaderboards to learn from others' designs which was half the point for me."
1999,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"September 1, 2021","Very annoying that every time I close and reopen it, the game thinks I'm playing for the first time and goes through the tutorial AND all previous bridges are deleted."

2001,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"November 26, 2021",A simple yet fun game about geometry and bridges. Can be challenging but adds to the experience.
2002,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"August 2, 2021",Extremely hard to learn the in depth controls of everything and there are no leaderboards or examples of other people's bridges to spark new ideas for my own. The lack of this ruins the game and makes it more or less trial and error instead of learning what went wrong and how to fix it
2003,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"August 9, 2021","Great game all around, physics are amazing and hilarious at times and the sandbox mode is perfect."

2008,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Top Paid,Role Playing,"August 4, 2021",It is a surprisingly fun game. I am only maybe 10 levels in but new things keep being added as I progress. As long as it has a good amount of levels and they become a bit more difficult I would suggest this game.

2098,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 3, 2021",Touch controls are absolutely horrendous. Movement is too slow and you lack the ability to EASILY control your characters. Got this on the Play Pass and I'd rather play it on my PC.

2100,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 9, 2021","Generally wonderful game. Complex gameplay and consequences. A little too unforgiving sometimes and the character controls are a bit clumsy. EDIT: when naming a character, the typing goes waaaaay too fast. Tapping one letter always inputs two..."

2104,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 4, 2021",This is actually a pretty challenging game. It a great addition to the game pass. I'll give you all one hint. For some reason it seems magic likes to hide under toilet seats. So make sure you check the bathrooms. But once again. A really good game.
2105,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 4, 2021","Poor control scheme. Simple action specific buttons are plenty for a mobile game, the mobile market isn't advanced enough to attempt innovation in the department mobile game controls."
2106,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 20, 2021",Very good! But i honestly think it gets way to hard with the constent seages at the end usually it ends up with their hardly being anyone left due to a lack of general medicine or food. Or even weapons
2107,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 22, 2021",Compared to the other versions I'd say the controls are a tad finicky but it's still perfectly playable and a great game.

2111,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"July 6, 2021",After playing hundreds of mobile games. This one has always been a favorite of mine. I remember so many people were mad when this came out but this game is very solid and extremely scary. It's a stressful experience which is perfect for what it was going for. Would highly recommend this game.

2115,Human: Fall Flat,3.6,$4.99 Buy,Top Paid,Puzzle,"December 14, 2021",Unplayable now unless you are zoomed all the way in.

My advice for the controls on Android; is to use your POINTER FINGER (and like all things practice) point and tap, mofo. Battle mode is self-explanatory and story mode is worth a quick'ol Square lap."
2133,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 7, 2021",So I'm using a One+ 8 Pro. The only way I could get the game to get past the opening black screen and to the pendulum is to swiped own and open the Gaming Mode notification and then go back to the game.

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was that the game itself needs to be a little bit brighter and easier to see for us old people with bad eyes. Lol. Now on to the next one!
2149,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 13, 2021","Very addictive! Great puzzles, graphics, and concept. Best escape room type app I've played. Would rate more stars if they were available."

2151,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 2, 2021","Very fun puzzle game with a interesting story. Not to hard, not too easy. Hints help quite a bit without giving too much away. The game itself isn't long (I beat it in a few hours), so I'd say it's .99 cents well spent."
2152,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 23, 2021",Probably one of the best games out there if you want to use your head. It's been a while since I played it but I've bought 3 from the series and am about to buy the 4th on my new phone. I'd have bought sooner if I realized the 4th was out. Really well thought out. Only wish was longer.

2154,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 27, 2021",Darn! This is challenging! Worth the download if you want to exercise your logic circuits. Puzzles are definitely fun!
2155,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 9, 2021","One thing I need to say "" I Love it "" for real. It keeps your mind open and it dose take some patience for this game. If you love a thinking 🤔 game it's the game for you."
2156,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 10, 2021",Best 99 cents ever. I was planning on sleeping at midnight at the latest and this game made me lose track of time in a really enjoyable way. Absolute blast!! I got lost and engaged at the same time at all times!!

2158,Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 6, 2021","Confused @ times, cause some of the puzzles were pretty intense - which is where the built in ""hint"" function comes in handy (points u in the right direction without giving 2 much away) great game"
2159,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 28, 2021",Wow that was a great adventure can you like add more onto it or like there is no game part 2 that would be fun.
2160,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 10, 2021",This is one of the best games I've ever played and that isn't hyperbole. It's has the humor of portal and the 5th wall breaking of Undertale. Play this if you love puzzles.
2161,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 15, 2021",Took about 5 hours to 100% so I guess it's 1$ per hour. More than my usual mobile game but was fun. Gameplay is the real winner here. Puzzles are unique and clever. Story's corny but charming in its own way
2162,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 14, 2021","Loved this game so much! Really enjoyed the out-of-the-box thinking. The characters were engaging and funny, and it was a great little journey through lots of different mobile game types."

2164,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 27, 2021",I've played some of the other ones but still like this one because it has a lot more than 14 and has better graphics than 20 plus you can have a helper drive them granted you have to pay for them so you lose money a bit faster but it's so helpful
2165,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 19, 2021",I love this game. Its one of the best ones ive played but the map needs to be bigger and actuall weather and season cycles. And there needs to be more equipment.
2166,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 1, 2021",So far this is the best farm simulator. I can't understand why they dropped the helper feature in '20.
2167,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 15, 2021",It is a good game. I wish you could color the trailers make your own farm and place buildings like sheds. I wish you could go in cab/ first person view or walk around your farm. I would like more jobs. I hope you guys can make this happen.
2168,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 13, 2021",Great Graphics! Start and stop whenever you want. Don't have to be online... My favorite FS version so far!

GIANTS even made it with no ads whatsoever! I'm very proud as someone who regularly sees the desktop version blow my mind. but... Farm Simulator 20 for mobile when? 👀"
2172,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 23, 2021",I really like this game I just have one problem I wish you could get in and out of car like in fs 20 and go in fpv mode

Ive been playing and improving the farm life everytime i play..its endless fun.. except for one small thing....need more animals like maybe some chickens.. hats off to whom designed this game. Good job....
2175,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 12, 2021",I have been a big fan of farming simulator games my whole life. Started with Sim Farm on Windows in the 90s. Loved Farming Simulator 14 and 16! Only problem I have with this one is the map design. It doesnt appeal to me as much as the prior map layout did. Add 1 more wash area as well.
2176,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 10, 2021","Hardly worth the money. Graphics are garbage, even on high. There's barely any content. Only 4 tractors. Can't get out and walk around. Can't buy buildings. All machines are essentially automatic. This game is just one step away from one of those stupid idle clicker games. SUPER boring."
2177,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"August 10, 2021","A bit too grindy to level up, but other than that, love that it's the classic fruit ninja. No idea why they decided to just nuke the original fruit ninja and make you rebuy stuff here, but whatever. Has some bug and lag problems (like golden dragon fruit just disappearing when sliced in a combo)"
2178,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 14, 2021","This is a fun and addicting game, especially with the powers! However, the play goes really fast if battery saver is not enabled on the Samsung Galaxy S21."
2179,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 30, 2021","I have played this a long time. But recently it will always run at 2x speed. Over the past 3 months I check to see if it is fixed, but still having the same issue. Samsung S20+"
2180,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 29, 2021","I say 5 stars, no ads, connection ISN'T needed, one thing to change, there is a word that rhymes with orange, ""Sporange"" it means casing spores in plants."
2181,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 12, 2021",I remember the old fruit ninja was way better. Leveling up just to unlock the blades sucks. I miss the old days.
2182,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 6, 2021","The fruits are incredibly fast to the point where it makes the game much harder to play, I don't remember them being that fast at all but that's not normal speed at all. If there was nothing actually wrong with old fruit ninja then don't try and ""fix"" it."
2183,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 25, 2021",The rating would be higher. But the game is speed up to where 1 minute of arcade is now 30 seconds. Even the music and menu are running faster to where it sound incorrect. I cant keep up with the game. My old phone had a 5 star experience. Now I have a new phone and yeah down to 1 star.
2184,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"November 10, 2021","The game is great. One of the very few mobile games I don't mind to still play. However, on the Galaxy S21, the fruits move much faster than they should if I don't put the phone in power saver mode. Please fix this. I am pretty sure my phone is too fast to allow the game to function correctly."
2185,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 15, 2021","Great game overall. Lots of stages and swords to unlock. 3 unique game modes. Fun and relaxing game that's great for casual or long play. Some challenges are difficult, but I still don't find the stressful at all. Highly recommended this game 👍."
2186,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"September 20, 2021","It's beautiful. It's plays the game. Doesn't offer nothin. No friggin ads. Wonderful. On another note, yes I played the free one but it doesn't play like this one does. (You don't need a connection to play this)"
2187,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"August 10, 2021",The fact that you pay .99 for no ads shouldn't mean that the game play is worse. The time clock is increased in speed as well as the fruit themselves. I will gladly go back to ads to avoid this. Very disappointing.
2188,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"August 16, 2021","I love this game!!! It is very much worth $0.99. I don't really like the free version because it has ads and it just doesn't feel like the ""original game of our childhood"". And I love the way it has the original design as well."
2189,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"July 9, 2021","Not worth it. No real unlockables, no other real game modes, no reason to have it other than an as excuse to lie that it's better to trick your friends. Just don't bother, and stick with the free version."

2191,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"July 27, 2021",Seeing a lot of comments about the game speed is too fast. You can fix this by setting your phone's motion smoothness to standard/60 hz and it will run at normal speed.
2192,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 23, 2021","Could you please add the new graphics from the remastered Fruit Ninja? They look really good and it would be cool to have them in the Classic version too, so we can have classic gameplay but with a modern and fresh feel"
2193,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"August 9, 2021","It's not like it used to be... without the leveling, no quests, just starfruit, and that's all that matters. I wish it was nostalgic like it used to be. Now it's all modernized"
2194,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"December 18, 2021",Its a fun time passer but considering im paying to play this id really like to know why it needs access to my photos/media and why with said access it puts ads on your device filling it with junk.
2195,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"September 28, 2021",Nothing like getting back to the classic Fruit Ninja! I'm always playing with my son and we can both say it's absolutely enjoyable! Great gameplay and seriously addicting!

2197,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"October 17, 2021",This game is better than the free one. I bought this because all my blades lost their abilities. And this version runs better. 99 cents well spent
2198,Call of Duty:Black Ops Zombies,3.1,$6.99 Buy,Top Paid,Action,"August 23, 2021",Bought this game then immediately bought the chainsaw blade (obviously) and right after starting up a game of classic the game crashed and I lost my chainsaw blade purchase. I hope this can be corrected. 😢
