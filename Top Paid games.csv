Marketplace - Discover the latest community creations in the marketplace! Get unique maps, skins, and texture packs from your favorite creators.",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe,"G1)THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER TO BE CREATED! I mostly play on PS4 not much on my tablet because it the controls are a little hard, and sometimes I delete it but then it regret it and when I go to try to download it again on my tablet it says I don't have enough storage space and I've tried everything to clear it. Overall, I LOVE MINECRAFT!!!! And I think everyone should try it! ?????(G2)I gave this game a 6 out of 5 because this game is so fun and it even has multiplayer and you can also get mods on this game without using the marketplace or going on sketchy website but I want one more thing added into the game that is more structures all the old structures are getting kind of old now and I want new ones and I'm also very excited about 1.18(S1)This game is very good I just feel like it needs more stuff to it like different dimensions actual Furniture so you don't have to build it but that's what mods are for but just why do you have to buy them but that is where random games can come in and you can just get different Minecraft mods from those even though sometimes it doesn't work the app is really good it just needs a couple more things that's all(S2)A fun game like always, But there something that i want you to add to this game and that is can you add dual wielding like java edition so i dont waste torch's when go exploring the cave for a diamond. And welcome to Minecraft logic= rain does not come from clous it comes from above clouds, we can have a lava bucket and the bucket is fine but if we throw the bucket to lava the bucket is destroyed. LOGIC(B1)I don't know what happened to this app but after I launch it on my Tab A 10.1, the app sits on a black screen for 5-20 minutes, THEN goes to the actual loading screen where it takes another 5-10, THEN the app finally loads. Loading ANY of my worlds is another 5-10 minute wait. This is egregious. Perhaps you guys should hire qualified people."
2,Geometry Dash,Arcade,4,"Jump and fly your way through danger in this rhythm-based action platformer!
Prepare for a near impossible challenge in the world of Geometry Dash. Push your skills to the limit as you jump, fly and flip your way through dangerous passages and spiky obstacles.
Simple one touch game play with lots of levels that will keep you entertained for hours!",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometryjump,"G1)ts a great game. For new players, you might experience gaming range, this is average to everyone. When you start playing the for the first time, you die. If you keep going and keep trying, youll become a pro, yeah, like me.(G2)Simply the ultimate mobile game; banner ads that only take up some of the screen (they dont even show up for me), an ENTIRE LEVEL EDITOR, tens of millions of levels to play, it's one of the best games. The fact that this is a mobile game as well makes it 10 times better since you can play it anywhere!(S1)Still, my review remains 4 stars. Yes, there needs to be some improvement, such as fixing the backup failed error that keeps popping up all the time, but your game is great! (Also, sometimes, my audio cuts out, taps gets randomly cancelled, and there are some other bad gameplay glitches on my end.(B1)Overall I absolutely love this game, but I've found a glitch on mobile where I will tap the screen, but then there's almost a full second of delay before it actually jumps in game, which really tends to mess me up to the point where I can barely do robtop levels. Because of this, my rating went from a 5 star to a 3 star.(B2)The game is good the gameplay is trash. Most of the old levels are almost copy's of each other the map packs are trash, we've waited 4 years for 2.2 finger dash is to easy the swing copter is the ship but with a new design most of your songs are unused because your not allowed to use it the vaults make you have to Google it or search it on youtube and the other two shops take way too long to do and the game is dead and clubstep is broken thank you and goodbye"
3,Bloons TD 6,Strategy,5,"Craft your perfect defense from a combination of awesome Monkey Towers, upgrades, Heroes, and activated abilities, then pop every last invading Bloon!

Join millions of other players who enjoy the massive and ever-expanding features that deliver endless hours of the best strategy gaming available.",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ninjakiwi.bloonstd6,"G1)A major improvement on the last title, with a whole extra upgrade path, an extra upgrade at the end of every path, several new monkey types, and the addition of heroes! The 3D art style was a bit wierd to get used to, but it does look amazing for both monkeys and maps. And with an incredible amount of maps in comparison to the other games, well, theres a lot to look at. I have had no issues with the mobile version so far, and I fully reccomend this game to any td enthusiest.(G2)Been playing since Bloons tower defense 1 came out when I was in middle school. This is probably by far one of the best tower defense games on the market as well as it ages like fine wine. There are so many maps, so many modes, so many towers with 3 individual paths, and so many bloon classes. I've been playing for over 2 years now and haven't even hit max level yet. As well as the community dedicated to this game. The only negative I can give this masterpiece are incredibly technical.(G3)the game is amazing and offers a ton for its price. Easily the best tower defence game, and possibly the best mobile game. I did, however, find a few flaws. crashes are frequent, at least for me, and tons of lag once you get to higher rounds, but other than that, this games offers so much. The new challenge editor makes for near limitless possiblities, and the featured challenges are updated daily maming this game difficult to get bored of. It is definetly worth your time and money.(S1)It would be better if you could zoom in some on this phone version. It can be hard placing monkeys some times especially when the monkey have a small zone, you cant see around your figure to see exactly where you want to place it, so it becomes a guessing game and you hope you hit the spot you were aiming. And if you dont youll have to sell it if you want it in the right spot and you end up losing money unnecessarily."
4,The Sun Origin: Post-apocalyptic action shooter,Action,4,"An action game with RPG elements in a cruel post-apocalyptic world, a world with radiation, hunger and disease. Only a few people managed to survive in that deadly attack that hit the planet from the space, but after a short time a new catastrophe started to threaten the survivors. And the main character, the Chosen of the North-216 Community, will have to deal with it.

World of the post-apocalypse. First person shooter for survival.",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agaming.thesun.origin,"G1)Great game! Kind of a challenge on a phone screen because the busy Ul. Get ready to pay attention, its not for babies! Has a day/night cycle, I only play when its daytime. Theres no sense facing danger when you cant see it!!(S1)Hello there devs! I'm a player and I mudt say that this game has been amazing so far!! I enjoyed every bit of it. Now here's the problem, the game lacks good control ,good framerate and proper english. Other than that everything is fine as it is.. or it could be better! Good luck on improving this game devs mad respect for ya!(S2)I looooove the game so much, but I have some tips, maybe make the food a little less expensive and the ammunition too, sometimes it's hard to get the money, also the game is good optimized but sometimes the menus are a little slow to load, also the bar to scroll down in the inventory is so small, overall this game is awesome I'm happy for buying it, it's worth it!(S3)This game isn't that bad, but please could you change a little thing call a movement, sensitive of screen, a jump and a running button because these so uncomfortable to play and if you can change some dialogue, it will be great(I found that some dialogue is not translated to English) also could you please including the graphic because it a little old, and the most important thing is that a food, drink and ammo are very hard to find. OK that's all I found in game hope you fix these(B1)I have a problem in entering forester's code in entrepot's safe. I actually had given the communicator back to him but before i gave it back, i screenshot the code. When im tryna entering it, the code is changed, it's become a false code. Please fix, i need the stuff behind that safe"

Stardew Valley",Role Playing,4.5,"Move to the countryside, and cultivate a new life in this award-winning open-ended farming RPG! With over 50+ hours of gameplay content and new Mobile-specific features, such as auto-save and multiple controls options.",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chucklefish.stardewvalley,"G1)I am a long time fan of the Harvest Moon series. Stardew Valley perfects the farming simulation genre that Harvest Moon started. There is always so much to do with a variety of ways to go about running your farm. You can customize your character, select your farmland, decorate your farm and house. The developer is a splendid person who is constantly updating the game and releasing content patches for free.(G2)Seriously wow! I never do game reviews but this game is totally worth it. There is years of game play with this game. If you like simulation, farming or Sims type games, this game is for you! There is SO much to do, so many things to unlock, it's jam packet with game play. Story line is great and not too much clicking through scenes. There is only one downfall, the guide at the beginning is very vague. I played for weeks not knowing there was a whole town to explore and unlock. So worth the cash(S1)This game is amazing. The only problem is with the controls. Using a controller can usually fix that, but there are certain things that are actually worse with a controller than with the touch screen. The biggest issue is that the slingshot fires a pellet in a single direction on every frame if you're using a controller, and you can't move while holding it. I hope it gets fixed soon.(S2)This game is truly amazing. Its relaxing, fun, and it is a very good time killer. The only thing I should suggest is more explanation on different aspects of the game, because alot of things aren't explained (and I only just figured out how to feed my chickens after a while of playing) but otherwise this is a great game(B1)My first review was deleted. I'm reposting that it's a shame that we spend on game that we don't get full access to. The content is several months( half year ) outdated. Also no feedback on reviews to see future goals. Basically it's end game after you complete the community center and then repetitive farming until they decide to update to the other platforms model. Their last update says Jan and now we are in September. refund or update please ."
6,Monopoly - Board game classic about real-estate!,Board,4,"Roll the dice, buy, sell, build and scheme your way to become a rich landlord in MONOPOLY! It’s the Hasbro board game and family classic loved by over a billion people in cities and countries worldwide. The classic board game you know and love is available on mobile and tablets and playable both offline and online!",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marmalade.monopoly,"G1)I really enjoy this. There are plenty of rigged claims about this game but I don't see it personally. I've won all but one of my games so far, against easy and medium opponents (yet to try hard). Gameplay is quick and smooth, and the options are laid out simply and clearly.(S1)Come onnnnn. Why tf players turn dont end. When they leave in between. There should be a timer in the players turn. Some players take forever to take turn and other just destroy the game by leave it on hold forever. Can you please fix it. I paid so much for the game. Please fix it.(S2)Love the game but please fix the way it cuts off background apps I like to listen to my music when I play and cuts off the music and if you try to get it back you forfeit the game. My only complaint(B1)Description will tell you everything you need to know in one sentence. ""Take risk & play the board game for friends & family by Hasbro online & offline"". When you can't even take the time to check you opening pitch, you know there are issues to come. Every new board and every peice more $$? Cannot reconnect to multiplayer after a crash, can't put in the code for said multi player and reconnect, sitting watching my screen play for me while it says ""reconnecting"". Charging $ for this????(B2)Freezes for no reason. And 9 times out of ten you can't finish a game you're winning because people will rage quit and sell all of their cards to a bot for $1. Or they'll mortgage and unmortgage their properties untill they have nothing left to pay. There needs to be a way to prevent that but there isn't."
7,Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,Arcade,4,"From the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockstargames.gtavc,"G1)I played this game on Playstation2, and knowing that GTA is on mobile that's even better. I had no issue with gameplay or saving data. Some of the missions are a challenge, and story mode is great..(S1)The game is good. But it needs to be upgraded. Rockstar, Upgrade the game, get in New Modern vehicles, Have more missions. Change the story a little, Make be little like GTA. Even the graphics, plus put in Promotions in to.(B1)Controls for driving are trash, the missions have almost no checkpoints so if mission is failed you gotta do the 25min mission from scratch. Only thing that looks nice is the driving graphics at night.(B2)o doubt the game is awesome but I'm facing some serious issues like freezing control control bug also I'm not able to buy something in game and it's crash sometimes please do something I also tried to reinstall it again and again but it isn't fixed yet so please give me a solution please ????????(B3)The graphics weren't very good. You have no control of vehicles. Not worth $4.99 should be a free game. Rope Hero has better graphics than this lame game!! Uninstalled this game and requested a refund."
8,RFS - Real Flight Simulator,Simulation,4,"Live a unique experience flying in any part of the world and exploring sceneries and airports in high resolution with satellite maps, 3D buildings, runways, procedures and air traffic. Jump on board of real time flights, chat with other pilots and join them in multiplayer. Manage flight plans and interact with ATC controllers. Get access to thousands of community created liveries, customize all airplanes, their gauges, failures and weather conditions.
Become a real pilot!",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.rortos.realflightsimulator,"G1)The gameplay and graphics is really good and I love how taxing has improved by showing a yellow sign where the destination bay is and you can follow the map knowing where your destination is. Before taxing was harder because you had to follow a map which wasn't as clear and not knowing where the destination bay is. This game has inspired me to become a future pilot. I didn't give 5 stars because the subscription is what let's it down, you don't get enough aircraft in the free version.(G2)#1 realistic flight simulators on Google play store. I tried the other competitors and even paid for the membership, but this one hands down was the best one. From the physics to the attention to details, it's amazing. Obviously you get more if you pay for a membership, so if you like this alot, I recommend getting one.(S1)I am a pilot, I really love this game but I find a few things wrong with this game. Usually I am not able to find access to internet when I'm at work making it impossible for me to play RFS PRO. I suggest once someone pays for PRO, they must be able to play even offline for the rest of their payment plan. If not, atleast add a Piper Cherokee to be part of the offline package. I would really appreciate.(S2)This game is by far the best mobile flight simulator I've ever tried, the attention to detail is exceptional and the variety of aircraft is generous. I have a few requests: Add a variety of more realistic cockpit alarms rather than the standard one. Add more realistic aircraft sounds, inside and out such as cabin noises, passengers talking, better landing noises and engines. More 3D airports with proper taxi ways, and more realistic gates with ground vehicles which behave realistically.(B1)I will change this rating when the team actually sort out my problem. I had bought a new phone and when reinstalled it, I lost all my hours. So the team told me to buy a subscription to which they would log me back in. They logged me in but I still don't have my hours and they insist on not giving me a refund, saying all my problems have been solved"
